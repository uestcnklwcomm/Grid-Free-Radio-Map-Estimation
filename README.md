# Grid-Free-Radio-Map-Estimation

This repository includes the code and dataset of paper 'Grid-Free Radio Map Estimation via Unsupervised Implicit Continuous Representation', submitted to IEEE Signal Processing Letters for possible publications. 
To implement the approach on simulated data, use script 'Grid_Free_RME_FSD.py'. To implement the approach on ray-tracing data [1], use script 'Grid_Free_RME_RMSeer.py'.
